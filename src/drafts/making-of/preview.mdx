It's been a long time since I had a personal website. Once upon a time I
procured `http://zak.ucsd.edu`, before UCSD stopped giving out whatever
top-level subdomain any student happened to want. My website was about the
simplest combination of HTML + CSS you could imagine:

<img src="/making-of/image.png" style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "350px" }} />

Alas, I could not procure lifetime access to this domain, so for quite a while I
was without a personal website.
