# Have your server side state and eat it too

## Start with React Server Components; seemlessly adopt client-side logic

I like to describe Next.js as a Sledgehammer. It's the kind of framework that
means to do provide everything you might want in website -- and, as the
framework has matured, it's done a pretty good job.

### Next.js is a complex beast

Need super-fast initial rendering and an amazing Lighthouse score; [Next.js has
you covered](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/seo/improve). Want to run a
function with a secret you can't expose to users;
[built-in](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns).
Use Next.js as a static site generator; [of
course](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).
Unfortunately, all these features come with complexity that you cannot really avoid.

I recently got hung up on whether to start development with server components or
client components. It's so neat that I can load a database resource in the
backend, ship a super-optimized HTML file that can be cached by CDN, and then
enliven that site on the frontend with client code (`"use client"`) the way
we've been doing in React single-page applications since the beginning of time
(uhh, 2014).

But what I could not figure out -- and this drove me crazy -- is how to take
that data from the server, say a list of user accounts, ship it to the frontend,
and then allow the user to mutate it. The usual answer is: Server Components
aren't _for_ that. They are designed for static data.

I don't accept that! I want a framework that let's me start with the fast path,
in this case server-side rendering, and seemlessly opt-in to the complex path,
in this case client-side mutation. Here's the pattern I settled on, which I
haven't seen anywhere else ([let me know](/contact) if you have a better way!):

### A basic React server component

Let's start with the most basic React server component:

```tsx

```
