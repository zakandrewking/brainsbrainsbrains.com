World simulators are universally fun as hell. So many great video games fall
into this category. Stone cold classics like SimCity and the Sims, Civilization
and MS Flight Simulator, and the tragically under-appreciated Spore in which you
take the reins on natural selection itself (OK, Spore isn’t an amazing *game*,
but as a world simulator it’s fantastic). Or take modern epics like Grand Theft
Auto and Red Dead Redemption — and the transcendental Goat Simulator. Playing a
world simulation game is like taking a break by sitting on the throne of God.

World simulators extend beyond gaming. I would categorize [Bartosz
Ciechanowski’s Mechanical Watch](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/)
simulator as a World Sim. Yes, it's a blog post, also a pedagogical tool, and a
neat web technology demo — but Bartosz's visuals are based on legitimate
simulations of mechanical behavior. Virtual springs and gears in his simulation
operate a lot like the real thing. The spring mechanics in particular are a joy
to interact with because they feel so real. If I needed to quickly get up to
speed with the functions of a mechanical watch, I can’t imagine a better
approach short of playing with a physical example  (incidentally, some 3D
printed mechanical watch simulators [can be found on
AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-Mechanical-watch-internal-structure-model.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.search.0)
or [built in Lego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRzgCylePjk)).

## Sims, sims everywhere

I’d argue that a World Sim can be any model of reality that’s both *predictive*
and *useful to understanding how our world works*. That's a broad definition; we
haven't even excluded paper atlases or the periodic table. That's fine! It’s fun to
think about just how many different ways intelligent beings can go about
modeling their world. Consider:

- [Digital Twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin), digital copies of
  the real world, are used in many engineering contexts to predict how existing
  systems will behave. (Do people really use these? Or is this just an
  addictive buzzword? I admit I like *the phrase* a lot.)

- AI models, all the rage right now, include many kinds of world sim. [The 1x
  World Model](https://www.1x.tech/discover/1x-world-model) is a fun recent
  example. Of particular interest to me is the tradeoff that AI models make,
  sacrificing longtail accuracy (hallucinations) to achieve incredible
  generalization & dynamic range.

- [Neuron](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) and
  [Brain](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/) simulations

- Any engineering game (e.g. [Poly Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_Bridge_%28video_game%29))

- Google Maps & Google Earth

- [Universe Sandbox](https://universesandbox.com/) and [Space
  Engine](https://spaceengine.org/)

- [Whole cell models of microorganisms](https://www.wholecell.org/)

Some visions of the metaverse portray it as a kind of World Sim—a one-to-one
map of reality. Or maybe what we want from a virtual world is to *bend* all
the annoyingly-strict rules of reality. Today's metaverse is famously just
Roblox; not a world sim _per se_, but a win for the benders of rules!
