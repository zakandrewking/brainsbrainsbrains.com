It's been a long time since I had a personal website. Once upon a time I
procured `http://zak.ucsd.edu`, before UCSD stopped giving out whatever top-level
subdomain any student happened to want. It was about the simplest combination
of HTML + CSS you could imagine:

<Image src={image} style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "350px" }} />

Alas, I could not procure lifetime access to that domain, so for a while I was
without a personal website.

I got the itch again to make a personal website, and I bought
([brainsbrainsbrains.com](https://brainsbrainsbrains.com)) because it's a cool
domain, and everything I do inevitably connects to a bunch of brains.

Around the same time, I ran across this delightful simulated Ink on Paper
drawing by [orbitanaut](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/orbitanaut) that I wanted to
try to recreate using only widely-supported web technologies. The image is an
NFT, so I guess it's nicer to direct you to the listing (is that what people do
with NFTs?):

I couldn't quite capture that effect in the end, but I did come up with a fun
"scroll" effect — try dragging the bottom of the scroll on the
[homepage](https://www.brainsbrainsbrains.com/) to see it in action! And I
learned a few things about building websites along the way.

## 1. We live in a skeuomorphic world

The classic touchpoint for skeuomorphism in modern software is [early Apple
iOS](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/08/23/what-apple-learned-from-skeuomorphism-and-why-it-still-matters),
from the release of the first iPhone to iOS 6. I remember getting an iPhone 4 in
college, and before that playing with GarageBand, with all its physically
inspired details: those skeuomorphic apps _felt_ a certain way. Of course, the
feelings of using those early iOS apps were skewed and colored by the hype and
stagecraft that Steve Jobs brought to the era. If you tried GarageBand after
watching the Apple product announcement, it felt like the future; it felt
special.

Fast-forward to 2024 and software doesn't feel like much to me. Most apps and
websites are flat and straightforward; everything feels like Slack. (The
software that makes you really _feel_ it today is AI — but that's a topic for
another time).

I mean, just soak in the old Notes app for a minute:

<Image src={image2} style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "450px" }} />

## 2. Putting pencil to paper

So I was in a nostalgic mood, and I wanted to bring back some skeuomorphism for
my website. I was going for a "handwritten with an ink pen on thick textured
paper" thing, but I also wanted this to serve as a functional blog that loads
quickly and requires minimal maintenance.

You can see the result on the [BrainsBrainsBrains
homepage](https://www.brainsbrainsbrains.com/) and on the [About
Me](https://www.brainsbrainsbrains.com/about-me) page.

<Image src={image5} style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "550px" }} />


Here's the approach I settled on for maximum feels:

- For paper texture, I’m using a simple SVG filter inspired by [Chokcoco on
  codepen](https://codepen.io/Chokcoco/full/OJWLXPY). It turns out you can
  [apply SVG filters to any HTML
  element](https://www.noupe.com/design/svg-filters-how-to-apply-them-to-html-elements-96298.html)!

```html
      <svg className="w-0 h-0">
        <filter id="rough-paper">
          <feTurbulence
            type="fractalNoise"
            baseFrequency="0.12"
            result="noise"
            numOctaves="3"
          />
          <feDiffuseLighting
            in="noise"
            lightingColor="#f9f5f0"
            surfaceScale="2"
          >
            <feDistantLight azimuth="90" elevation="75" />
          </feDiffuseLighting>
        </filter>
      </svg>
```

- For pencil effects, I originally set up a SVG filter on text elements inspired
  by the [wonderful site, Here Dragons
  Abound](https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/creating-pencil-effect-in-svg.html),
  but the performance on mobile Safari was terrible, and I wanted everything to
  render dynamically, especially text and links. I want a website, not a giant
  PNG. So instead, text is a handwriting font called
  [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat).
- To add a bit more to the effect, I applied that slow pencil-effect filter from
  Here Dragons Abound to some Emojis & unicode characters, captured screen grabs
  of them, removed the backgrounds, and included them as images.
- Finally, I wanted to set up simulate some hand-drawn decorations, so I turned
  to [Rough.js](https://roughjs.com/). You can see the effect in the rectangles
  around the Link and Bio sections, and also the little doodle at the bottom of
  the scroll. To keep decorations from recalculating when you navigate, I put some
  [Rough.js Generators](https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough/wiki/RoughGenerator)
  in a store that persists across navigation events. Here's the doodle:

<Image src={image4} style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "160px" }} />

- There's another library called [RoughNotation](https://roughnotation.com/)
  that I used to add little underline animations when you hover a cursor over a
  link on Desktop.
- All this has to work in dark-mode of course, because that's what we do now, we
  web devs. It respects [OS
  settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme),
  but maybe I'll add a selector later.

## 3. The scroll

At some point, I decided that the virtual paper should roll up like a scroll.
This was the funnest part; and tricky, because the "rolled up" scroll would
appear on the home page, the "unrolled scroll" would appear the About Me page
(with a photo and a bio), and the whole thing would need work whether you are
using a touch screen to unroll the scroll or clicking a good-old-fashioned
hyperlink to navigate between pages.

Behind the scenes, this site runs on Next.js with server-side-generation (SSG),
deployed on GitHub pages, because that was an easy option and performs great —
it generates a bunch of HTML and CSS up-front; it even works with javascript
disabled!

A couple tricks were required to make the scroll work as a [progressive
enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement),
i.e. something that works when javascript is ready, but doesn't interfere with
the good old-fashioned HTML & CSS that we ship on first load.

For the drag effect, I turned to [d3-drag](https://d3js.org/d3-drag). Browser
drag effects are surprisingly annoying out-of-the-box, and d3-drag standardizes
a few things across different interaction types (mouse vs. touch especially).
When you drag, the site disables the CSS scroll animation temporarily and turns
to d3 for updating the DOM. When you finish dragging, d3 turns off, and the CSS
animation turns back on, and we update the height of the scroll to whatever
stop-point we need, depending on whether you're navigating from Home to About
Me, or the other way around.

To make it all feel a little more like paper, we only render two possible widths
(`350px` and `750px`); no dynamic changes unless you cross the breakpoint.

## 4. Everything else

The rest of this site is the simplest Next.js + markdown blog template
imaginable. I added [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and some
[shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components because they're convenient, but you
won't find many other tricks in the codebase. It's all [open source Apache 2.0
code](https://github.com/zakandrewking/brainsbrainsbrains.com) if you'd like
peruse.

Hopefully you've enjoyed visiting a webpage that looks like a bumpy sheet of
paper on which someone has scribbled his name.
